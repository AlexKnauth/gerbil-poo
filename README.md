# Gerbil-POO

Gerbil-POO is an implementation of Prototype Object Orientation for Gerbil.
This object model is directly inspired by that of Nix, isomorphic to that of Jsonnet.

### HACKING

If you'd like to build your own object system, with its own optimized meta-object protocol
to implement objects efficiently, come join the team!

Here are a few projects you might be interested in:

* Implement the "usual" optimizations that e.g. SBCL uses for CLOS.
* [A good type system for prototype inheritance](https://github.com/fare/projects/issues/3)
* [A compositional MOP for Prototype Inheritance](https://github.com/fare/projects/issues/7)
* [Efficient, Incremental, Generic, Isomorphism-aware, Correct Data Structures](https://github.com/fare/projects/issues/10)
